# Meetings

## October 2020

### 16th October - [Jose Labra](http://labra.weso.es/) - Shapes applications and tools

### 9th October - [Daniel Fernández](http://danifdez.weso.es/) - Wikidata hackathon

Dani makes a brief introduction about Wikidata, Commons, Wikibase, and how these projects are related and integrated in the Wikimedia's ecosystem. Then, he introduces the idea of organizing a hackathon to produce apps which use the data available in Wikidata and Commons. This is a first meeting to discuss several dimensions of this project: targte public, which external external organizations may have interest in participating, scope of the hackathon, dates, people within WESO interested this initiative... some conclussions arise:

* Dani will be the person leading the organization of this initiative.
* The target participants will be essentially composed by technical profiles, althaugh we do not discard to invite or involve people with non-technical profiles from different knowledge areas.
* There is an obvious need of involving external organizations (at least the EII) and invest time producin an efficient marketing to reach our target public.
* We want to keep a collaborative spirit for the event, but also to be able to give some kind of reward to the best proposal(s).
* We start a separate channel within WESO to keep developing this idea.

### 21th: [Herminio García](http://herminiogarcia.com)
 
 Herminio presents the proposal titled 'Translating from AMR to RDF and SPARQL: A position paper'. In this work we propose AMR as a useful tool in order to achieve automatic translation between natural language entries and semantic web standars. We discuss techniques to perform this translation.
